**Overview of the Project**

   This project aims to utilize the Python programming language along with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit to create a comprehensive system for gathering and storing YouTube data. The primary objectives include the collection, storage, and analysis of YouTube data to facilitate tasks such as content recommendation, trend analysis, and gaining insights into user behavior. The integrated use of these technologies allows for a robust and scalable solution, enabling users to explore and make informed decisions based on the gathered YouTube data.



**Tools Used**

   **Python Programming Language:**
        Python is chosen for this project due to its versatility, user-friendly syntax, and the extensive ecosystem of libraries. These attributes make it well-suited for various tasks involved in the YouTube data harvesting and warehousing project, including web scraping, data processing, and analysis.

   **Google API Client:**
        The googleapiclient library acts as a crucial component in the project, facilitating the communication between the Python code and YouTube Data API v3. Its streamlined interface allows developers to access, manipulate, and harvest YouTube data efficiently, contributing to the overall success of the project's goals such as content recommendation, trend analysis, and user behavior insights.

   **PostgreSQL:**
        PostgreSQL serves as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for this project, chosen for its ability to efficiently store structured data while offering robust features such as ACID compliance and support for complex queries.

   **MongoDB:**
        MongoDB is employed as the NoSQL database for this project, primarily because of its ability to handle semi-structured and unstructured data. Its strength lies in its flexible approach to data representation (flexible schema) and scalability, making it an ideal choice for managing a variety of data types that may not adhere to rigid, predefined structures.

   **Streamlit:**
        Streamlit is utilized in this project to create interactive and customizable web-based data dashboards. Its purpose is to simplify the process of visualizing the YouTube data that has been harvested, enabling users to easily explore and interact with the information in a user-friendly and dynamic online interface.
